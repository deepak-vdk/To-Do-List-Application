# To-Do List Application

## 📌 Project Description
This is a **console-based To-Do List application** built using Core Java. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, viewing, marking as complete, and deleting tasks. The project follows **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles** and demonstrates file handling in Java.

---

## 🎯 Features
✅ Add tasks to the to-do list  
✅ View all tasks with status (Pending/Completed)  
✅ Mark tasks as completed  
✅ Delete tasks from the list  
✅ Save tasks to a file (tasks persist even after exiting)  
✅ Load tasks from a file on startup

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Java, OOP)
- **Scanner Class** (User input handling)
- **ArrayList** (Data storage)
- **File Handling** (Read/Write operations in a text file)
